# PyPI_units
My tweaks to the PyPI units module

The bulk of the content of this repository is from the PyPI module named units:
https://pypi.org/project/units/

Until such time that the maintainer of that module allows me to contribute to its development, I am using this repo for the CM of of my modifications.
